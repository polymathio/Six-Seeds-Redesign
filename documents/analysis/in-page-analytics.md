#In Page Analytics Breakdown for SixSeeds

###Tim's Questions
1. *Are breadcrumbs actually getting any clicks?*
	- It looks like the only breadcrumb clicks are people clicking "Home" from the Channel landing page (to go back to Patheos Homepage). 5.7%
	- Minimal breadcrumb activity on blog-level pages.(0.4% navigating back to patheos)
2. *What actually gets clicks, in the nav?*
	- On the Channel Landing Page, it looks like the only navigation people are using is to get away from the channel back to the main Patheos page.
		- Patheos logo (5.7%)
		- Breadcrumb home (5.7%)
	- On the Blog Home page (using Sean Lowe for all examples) It seems like navigation is confusing because the most commonly clicked links take users back to the same page they are already on.
		- Blog Branding (to get back to blog home) 7.2%
		- Blog Home button (to get back to blog home) 7.2%
		- Blog Archive 1.9%
3. Skipping this at Tim's request
4. *Does anything in the footer get clicks? [DANIEL: Is there any such thing as a footer in a lazy-loading blog page like we're talking about?]*
	Nothing in the footer gets clicked ever.
5. *Nancy has been very keen on doing things to grow the email lists. Are we giving her -- in these wireframes -- the tools she needs?*
	I think we need to have a conversation with Nancy and Chandler about branding, social, newsletters and the priorities of each of those things. We are not doing the best we could do for newsletter subscriptions, but we should identify which newsletters we care about growing most.
6. *I think we should probably move "Stay Up to Date with SixSeeds" (in the sidebar) up on top of the "Popular at SixSeeds" list.*
	Let's talk to Jon about this
7. *I see a "previous feature in the body of a blog post. May be a good idea? Is there a better way of doing that?*
